# Todo-Manager
Enhanced version of a to-do list manager that allows users to manage tasks with categories, priorities, due dates, and status updates. Users can add, remove, view, mark tasks as done, save tasks to a file, and load tasks from a file. The program uses a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interaction.
